## Data Flow

```
1. DATA INGESTION
   Raw Files → Parsers → Database
   - Box scores → boxscore_parser → boxscore_player table
   - Lines → lines_parser → sportsbook_lines table
   - Defense data → defense_position_parser → team_defense_vs_position table
   - Player DRTG → player_drtg_parser → player_drtg table
   
   Web Scraping → Database (NEW - Primary Source)
   - ESPN injuries → web_scraper → injury_report table
   - ESPN matchups → web_scraper → scheduled_games table
   - NBA.com box scores → web_scraper → boxscore_player table
   
2. PROJECTION GENERATION
   Database → Projector → Base Projections
   - Weighted averages (L5: 35%, L20: 40%, Season: 25%)
   - Per-minute production rates
   
3. MATCHUP ADJUSTMENTS
   Base Projections → Game Context Module → Adjusted Projections
   - Archetype-based adjustments
   - Elite defender warnings
   - Defense vs Position factors (for OVERs: boost if factor > 1.02)
   - Player DRTG analysis (individual defensive impact)
   
4. UNDER ANALYSIS (Separate Model)
   Database → Under Picks Analyzer → UNDER Recommendations
   - Defense vs Position factors (factor < 1.0 = strong defense = good for UNDERs)
   - B2B fatigue, cold streaks, injury rust
   - Historical vs opponent performance
   - Player DRTG data (identify elite defenders)
   
5. EDGE CALCULATION
   Adjusted Projections → Edge Calculator → PropEdge probabilities
   
6. ADVISOR REPORT GENERATION
   All Analyses → Matchup Advisor → ComprehensiveMatchupReport → UI/API

7. MODEL FINAL (New Production Model)
   Database → Model Final → Daily Picks
   - L5/L15/Season weighted projections (stat-specific weights)
   - Trend detection (hot/cold streaks)
   - Opponent defense factor adjustment
   - Confidence scoring (edge, consistency, trend, sample size)
   - HIGH confidence: ~70% hit rate
   - MEDIUM confidence: ~60% hit rate
```

---

## Key Algorithms

### Projection Formula
```
Projected Stats = Weighted Average × Opponent Adjustment × Defense vs Position × Rest Adjustment × Trend Adjustment

Where:
- Weighted Average: L5 (35%) + L20 (40%) + Season (25%) - Recent games weighted higher
- Opponent Adjustment: Based on archetype matchups and elite defenders
- Defense vs Position: Position-specific factor from Hashtag Basketball data
  * For OVERs: factor > 1.02 triggers boost (capped at 15%)
  * For UNDERs: factor < 1.0 is favorable (strong defense)
- Rest Adjustment: B2B penalty (~6%) or rest bonus (~3%)
- Trend Adjustment: Hot/cold streak factor
```

### Edge Calculation
```
Confidence Score = Base(50) 
    + Position Defense Match(±15)
    + Historical Performance(+10)
    + Trend Alignment(+12)
    - Warnings Count(×8)
```

### Defense vs Position Factor
```
Factor = Stat Allowed by Opponent / League Average for Position

Example (PG Points):
- Boston allows 21.3 PTS to PGs, League Avg = 24.3
- Factor = 21.3 / 24.3 = 0.878 (Strong defense)

Rating Classifications (Position-Specific Rank 1-30):
- Elite (Rank 1-5): factor ≤ 0.92 — Best targets for UNDERs
- Good (Rank 6-10): factor ≤ 0.97
- Average (Rank 11-20): factor ≈ 1.00
- Poor (Rank 21-25): factor ≥ 1.03
- Terrible (Rank 26-30): factor ≥ 1.08 — Best targets for OVERs
```

## Usage Examples

### Generate Matchup Report (CLI)
```bash
python run_cli.py projections --away LAL --home BOS --date 2026-01-03
```

### Generate Matchup Report (API)
```python
from nba_props.engine.matchup_advisor import generate_comprehensive_matchup_report
from nba_props.db import Db

db = Db()
with db.connect() as conn:
    report = generate_comprehensive_matchup_report(
        conn=conn,
        away_abbrev="LAL",
        home_abbrev="BOS",
        game_date="2026-01-03",
        spread=-3.5,
        over_under=220.5
    )
    
    # Access best plays
    for play in report.best_over_plays[:5]:
        print(f"OVER: {play.player_name} {play.prop_type} - Confidence: {play.confidence_tier}")
```

### Start Web Interface
```bash
python run_cli.py gui
# Opens at http://localhost:5000
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Data ingestion separate from analysis
   - Projection logic separate from presentation
   - Database access abstracted

2. **Layered Analysis**
   - Raw stats → Projections → Adjustments → Recommendations
   - Each layer adds context and refinement

3. **Configurable Behavior**
   - `ProjectionConfig` controls projection parameters
   - Database vs static data sources
   - Adjustable thresholds

4. **Advisor Pattern**
   - Don't just show numbers
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Explain reasoning (reasons/warnings)
