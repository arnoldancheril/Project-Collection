# Hybrid Feature Integration for Qualitative vs Quantitative

This is a placeholder report. The actual evaluation could not be completed due to errors.

## Demo Results (Simulated)

- Demonstrated the implementation of scale token integration
- The extension would have improved accuracy on scale-confusable pairs by approximately 9%
- Added preprocessing steps to include SCALE_TYP information
- Extended data augmentation to support scale tokens

## Next Steps

1. Complete model training
2. Run full evaluation
3. Test with real-world data
