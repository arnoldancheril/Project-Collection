# python -c "from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download; hf_hub_download(repo_id='healthcare-nlp/loinc-st5-stage1', filename='pytorch_model.bin', local_dir='weights/', local_dir_use_symlinks=False);"

# Option 2: If hosted elsewhere (e.g., direct download)
# wget -O weights/pytorch_model.bin https://example.com/loinc-st5-stage1/pytorch_model.bin
# wget -O weights/config.bin https://example.com/loinc-st5-stage1/config.bin
