- Filter rail on the left for quick filtering
- Table of applications with status indicators

### Adding Applications

Click the "Add Application" button to add a new job application:
- **Company field**: Features auto-complete with your frequently used companies. Start typing to see suggestions, or click the dropdown to browse companies you've applied to before.
- **Role field**: Includes predefined software engineering roles (Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer, etc.) plus your previously used roles. You can select from the dropdown or type a custom role.
